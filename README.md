Predictive Data Analysis and Model Evaluation on MIMIC-3 Dataset
Project Overview
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling of the MIMIC-3 clinical dataset. It involves uncovering relationships between patient demographics, medical conditions, and clinical outcomes, followed by predictive model evaluation to optimize performance.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
MIMIC-3 Dataset
Power BI

Key Features

Extensive EDA to explore patient characteristics, vital signs, medical history, and disease severity.
Statistical analysis (t-tests, chi-square, Wilcoxon signed-rank) to identify key relationships within the data.
Data preprocessing including handling missing data, standardization, and outlier detection.
Machine learning models for predictive analysis, with performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
Error analysis on false positives/negatives and bias mitigation through statistical tests.
Visual storytelling with Power BI to present clinical insights.


Usage

Use Phas2_Team4_Random_Forest_Miii.ipynb for the exploratory data analysis and statistical tests and to apply machine learning models and evaluate their performance on the clinical data.
